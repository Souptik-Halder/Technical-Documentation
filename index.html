                <li><h3>Frame it all</h3></li>
                <p>With the vlog camera ZV-1 II, you can shoot everything from group selfies to sprawling cityscapes.<br> 
                    The wide-angle 18 mm2 lens can capture a wider field of view than the human eye, so you can easily<br> 
                    fit everyone or everything in the frame. Whether you're indoors or out, the wide-angle lens turns<br> 
                    everyday scenes into dynamic footage.<br>

                <li id="versatile_framing"><h3>Versatile framing</h3></li>
                <p>The ZV-1 II lets you frame your shots exactly how you want, thanks to its wide-angle zoom lens.<br>
                    18 mm2 is great for selfies, while 50 mm2 is ideal for portraits and snapshots. What's more, the<br>
                    maximum apertures of F1.8 with the wide-angle and F4 with the telephoto give a smooth background<br> 
                    bokeh, adding all the atmosphere you need.<br>

                <p>No experience is needed to make an impressive vlog with all the right visuals from the outset.<br>
                    My Image Style3 lets you simply tweak brightness and colour while viewing what you plan to<br>
                    shoot—all without having to wade through menus. For shots with more creative colour and mood,<br> 
                    Creative Look offers 10 presets so simply select one that matches your vision.<br>

                <p>Just tap the screen to turn everyday moments into cinematic imagery, all without post-production editing.<br>
                    With the Cinematic Vlog Setting4, the camera automatically shoots in a Cinemascope aspect ratio5 at<br> 
                    24fps6—the film industry standard. You can also change the colour of your footage simply by selecting<br>
                    from five LOOKs and four MOODs for instant, professional results.<br></p>

                <li><h3>Built-in mic for clear voice recording</h3></li>
                <p>In [Auto] mode, the new built-in Intelligent Three-Capsule Mic switches7 the direction of the built-in mic<br>
                    from [All Directions] to [Front] when the camera recognises a human face in the frame. Or you can switch<br> 
                    manually to [Front] for selfies or [Rear] when shooting with narration. Attach a supplied windscreen to<br> 
                    reduce wind noise and capture clearer audio outdoors.<br></p>

                <li><h3>Effortlessly portable</h3></li>
                <p>Small and lightweight, the vlog camera ZV-1 II is designed to be taken out anywhere—just like your smartphone.<br>
                   Weighing just 292 g 8, capture everyday life with ease and grab content on the go.<br></p>

                <li><h3>Simple, intuitive control</h3></li>
                <p>Even first-time vloggers can jump straight into shooting with the ZV-1 II; there's no need to study complex settings.<br>
                    Touch function icons like recording and self-timer are displayed on the screen for easy control. These are also great<br> 
                    for shooting selfies or in other situations when you can't reach the physical buttons on the camera.<br></p>

                <li><h3>Focus on you</h3></li>
                <p>The ZV-1 II automatically makes sure that you always stay in focus with Touch Tracking. It recognises human<br>
                    faces and eyes, so it tracks the main subject without wandering off. Just tap the subject on the screen to<br>
                    activate the feature. Eye AF can even be set to track animal faces and eyes.<br></p>

                <li><h3>Stand out with just a tap</h3></li>
                <p>The ZV-1 II is designed for easier content creation. Activate the Product Showcase Setting and the camera will<br> 
                    automatically focus on the product you're holding with no additional gestures needed. Or use Bokeh Switch to<br> 
                    get a softly blurred background—simply select [Defocus] to make the subject stand out, or [Clear] to keep the<br>
                    entire image in focus.<br></p>

                <li><h3>Selfies made simple</h3></li>
                <p>Let the ZV-1 II work for you to capture great group moments. When taking selfies in iAUTO mode with two or three<br> 
                    people, the camera automatically adjusts the setting to keep everyone's faces sharp and clear<br></p>
                
                <li><h3>Always look your best</h3></li>
                <p>Look your best any time you're shooting. Without any special settings, the ZV-1 II accurately captures your<br>
                    skin tone, ensuring a healthy and natural look. Face Priority AE automatically brightens your face so there's<br> 
                    no need to worry about lighting either. There's also a Soft Skin Effect selectable to OFF/Low/Mid/High to adjust<br>
                    your skin smoothness.<br></p>

                <li><h3>Always know when you're recording</h3></li>
                <p>Say goodbye to accidentally missing the action. When you press the MOVIE button or tap the record icon on the LCD screen,<br>
                    the recording lamp glows red and a red frame appears on the screen, letting you know instantly that you're capturing what counts.<br> 
                    The rotatable screen means you can also track recording while shooting from any angle.<br></p>

            <h1>Advanced Features</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>High-quality imagery</h3></li>
                <p>The ZV-1 II packs powerful specs in its compact body, offering impressive image quality. Its large<br> 
                    1.0-type image sensor means it can capture professional-level footage, shooting in XAVC S format<br> 
                    up to 30p and in 4K, and up to 120p16 in Full HD for up to 5x slow motion. It also supports<br> 
                    simultaneous proxy recording17 for efficient post-production workflow.<br></p>

                <li><h3>Grows with your creativity</h3></li>
                <p>With the ZV-1 II, it's easy to take the next steps towards boosting your videography skills.<br> 
                    Just like professional Cinema Line or α series cameras, the ZV-1 II supports S-Log3 and<br>

                <li><h3>Built-in ND filter</h3></li>
                <p>The ZEISS® Vario-Sonnar T* 18–50 mm18 F1.8–4 zoom lens has a built-in neutral density (ND) filter<br> 
                    to control light exposure by three stops, giving images more expressiveness in bright light.<br>

            <h2>Reducing our environmental footprint</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Road to Zero</h3></li>
                <p>Inspired by the beauty of the world, Sony is doing its part to help preserve the Earth while still<br> 
                    allowing creators to produce even more beautiful and creative imagery. With a goal of achieving a<br>
                    zero environmental footprint across the entire Sony Group by the year 2040, we are accelerating<br>
                    numerous initiatives for the environment.<br></p>

                <li><h3>Non-plastic outer packaging</h3></li>
                <p>The outer packaging of the ZV-1 II does not contain plastic20, but instead uses Sony's Original<br> 
                    Blended Material, consisting of bamboo, sugar cane and recycled paper. This unique blend not<br> 
                    only produces high-quality and durable packaging, but it is also recyclable for an even lower<br> 
                    environmental impact.<br></p>

                <li><h3>Recyclable non-plastic packaging materials</h3></li>
                <p>Sony is working towards the use of non-plastic packaging materials, while still providing ample<br> 
                    protection during shipping. We are also using plant-based non-woven fabrics for product bags.<br> 
                    All of this helps to minimise our environmental impact.<br></p>

                <li><h3>Using recycled plastic</h3></li>
                <p>SORPLAS™ is a Sony-developed durable and repeatedly recycled material. We use it in conjunction<br> 
                    with other recycled materials to manufacture camera bodies without compromising performance and<br> 
                    functionality. Approximately 379 tons23 of virgin plastic have been replaced by recycled plastics<br> 
                    in our digital cameras and digital video cameras over the past 10 years.<br></p>

                <li><h3>Wind screen using recycled polyester</h3></li>
                <p>The fibres used in the wind screen provided with the ZV-1 II are made exclusively from recycled PET bottles.<br> 
                    Extensive testing was carried out to ensure that sound quality and wind noise reduction performance were fully<br> 
                    up to our standards, achieving environmental impact reduction without compromising functionality.<br></p>
